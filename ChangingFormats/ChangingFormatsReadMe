  ChangingForms.py is a program I created last year as a part of a
    homework assignment for COSC 455 (Graph Theory). This program
    converts adjacency matrices to adjacency lists and back. I post it
    here because I'm currently working on a few other algorithms
    involving graphs and this infrastructure to turn adjacency lists
    to matrices is useful for my own sanity.  It could do with some
    refinement, I'm certain. Beyond just refactoring, it'd probably be
    a good idea to have these algorithms focus less on string
    concatenation and manipulation. I'll get on that one day,
    hopefully.
